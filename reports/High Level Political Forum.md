## Executive Summary

The High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development, convened under the Economic and Social Council, has faced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change, which have hindered progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 2023 session emphasized the need for urgent, transformative actions to accelerate recovery and implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Key discussions highlighted the importance of inclusive financing, multi-stakeholder partnerships, and local engagement to address vulnerabilities, particularly for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The forum underscored the necessity of integrating climate action, gender equality, and technological innovation into recovery strategies. With 38 countries presenting Voluntary National Reviews, the HLPF called for renewed global commitment and collaboration to ensure no one is left behind, particularly vulnerable populations. The upcoming SDG Summit is seen as a pivotal opportunity to reaffirm commitments and catalyze action towards achieving the SDGs by 2030.
