# Strengthening AI Regulatory Frameworks: The EU-LAC Digital Alliance Statement

**Date**: 2023-11-16

**Location**: Madrid, Spain


## Executive Summary

On November 16, 2023, during the AI Alliance Assembly in Madrid, representatives from the EU and several Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries reaffirmed their commitment to the Digital Alliance, established in July 2023. This initiative aims to enhance human-centric digital cooperation and promote the convergence of digital policy and regulatory frameworks, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI). The upcoming EU Regulation on AI will set safety and rights-based requirements for AI providers, including the establishment of regulatory sandboxes for innovation. The participating states agreed to exchange best practices, implement guidelines, and maintain ongoing dialogue to ensure that AI development respects human rights while fostering innovation. This collaborative effort seeks to address the challenges posed by emerging AI technologies and ensure that they cater to diverse linguistic and cultural contexts across the regions.
