# "Regulatory Roadmap for Enhancing Digital Trade in Mercosur"

**Date**: 2018-10

**Location**: Mercosur (Southern Cone of South America)


## Executive Summary

The report "Fueling Digital Trade in Mercosur: A Regulatory Roadmap" by Kati Suominen highlights the rapid growth of digital trade in Mercosur, with Brazil and Argentina emerging as regional leaders. Despite significant advancements, most digital transactions remain domestic, hindered by regulatory inconsistencies across member countries. Key challenges include varying data privacy laws, taxation issues, and logistics complexities. The report emphasizes the need for regulatory coherence to facilitate cross-border ecommerce, particularly for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Recommendations include creating smart digital regulations, enhancing customs procedures, and fostering public-private partnerships to improve access to finance and digital skills. Establishing a regional Digital Dialogue is proposed to align policies and share best practices, ultimately aiming to unlock the full potential of digital trade in the region and drive economic growth.

## Future Commitments

- Brazil's data protection law, Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD), passed in 2018, will go into effect in 2020.
- Mercosur companies estimate that improving digital regulations would enable them to increase their revenues and exports by almost 30 percent annually.
- If the top-3 constraints to doing ecommerce were removed, Mercosur companies would score annual revenue gains of 34 percent in domestic markets and 35 percent in international markets.
- The proposal for a "Trusted eTrader" program includes a period of 18 months for SMEs to consistently comply with trade regulations to become trusted traders whose shipments are fast-tracked through customs.
