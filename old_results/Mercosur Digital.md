# Regulatory Roadmap for Enhancing Digital Trade in Mercosur

**Date**: 2018-10

**Location**: Mercosur (Southern Cone of South America)


## Executive Summary

The report "Fueling Digital Trade in Mercosur: A Regulatory Roadmap" by Kati Suominen highlights the rapid growth of digital economies within Mercosur, where online sales have outpaced traditional trade. Brazil leads Latin America in e-commerce, while Argentina and Uruguay are emerging as tech hubs. However, most digital transactions remain domestic due to fragmented regulations across member countries, particularly concerning data privacy, taxation, and online service regulations. The report emphasizes the need for regulatory coherence to facilitate cross-border digital trade, particularly for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Key recommendations include creating interoperable regulations, modernizing customs procedures, and fostering public-private partnerships to enhance digital skills and access to finance. Establishing a regional Digital Dialogue is also proposed to align policies and promote a cohesive digital market, ultimately driving economic growth and job creation across the region.


## Characteristics

- Mercosur has emerged as a digital leader in Latin America, with significant growth in e-commerce, particularly in Brazil and Argentina.
- Digital trade is growing faster than overall trade, but most transactions remain domestic due to regulatory inconsistencies.
- Companies that engage in online sales are more likely to export and grow, with online sellers showing greater market diversification.
- Key challenges for SMEs include access to finance, logistics, customs procedures, and complex digital regulations.
- Improving the regulatory environment could boost revenues and exports by nearly 30% annually for Mercosur companies.
- A coherent regional digital market is essential for scaling businesses and enhancing competitiveness in the global market.
