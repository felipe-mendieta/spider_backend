# Regulatory Roadmap for Enhancing Digital Trade in Mercosur

**Date**: 2018-10

**Location**: Mercosur (Southern Cone of South America)


## Executive Summary

The report "Fueling Digital Trade in Mercosur: A Regulatory Roadmap" by Kati Suominen highlights the rapid growth of digital economies within Mercosur, where online sales have outpaced traditional trade. Brazil leads Latin America in e-commerce, while Argentina and Uruguay are emerging as startup hubs. However, most digital transactions remain domestic, hindered by inconsistent regulations across member countries regarding data privacy, taxation, and online services. The report emphasizes the need for regulatory coherence to facilitate cross-border digital trade, particularly for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Key recommendations include creating interoperable regulations, modernizing customs procedures, and fostering public-private partnerships to enhance digital skills and access to finance. Establishing a regional Digital Dialogue is proposed to align policies and promote a vibrant digital market, ultimately driving economic growth and job creation in the region.


## Characteristics
